# wikiExtension ðŸ”Ž
Browser extension that allows the user to quickly search for a wikipedia page without having to change tabs.

## Running the extension
To run the extension you only have to follow a couple of steps, determined by your browser. (Jump to <a href="#firefox">Firefox</a> / <a href="#chrome">Chrome</a>)

### Firefox

For Firefox navigate to 'about:debugging' in your browser. Then click 'This Firefox' in the menu to left. After that you should be able to see a button that says 'Load Temporary Add-on'. Opening any file from the current directory (unzipped) will allow the extension to work.


### Chrome

In Chrome navigate to 'chrome://extensions'. On the extensions page toggle the developer options (top-right) to on. Toggling this on should display three new buttons at the top of the page. Click the 'Load unpacked' button. This will open the File Explorer, navigate to the root directory of this project and press open to add the extension to Chrome.
