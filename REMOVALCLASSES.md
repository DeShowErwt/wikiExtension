# Classes to remove
We remove a couple of classes from the Wikipedia response. If you want to change the function of this extension you might wonder why. We got their functions and reason for removal lined up in this document.

## Infobox
Infoboxes dont provide us with the easily readable first couple of lines (which the application is built to serve up). They contain all types of basic information, for people think about marriages, accomplishments for athletes etc. For things or brands think about the date they were introduced etc.

## Hatnotes
Hatnotes are notes by Wikipedia which help the user to navigate on wikipedia. However they are not functional to someone who wants to see the first couple of lines of an article.

## References
References are useful for linking to the sources that were cited for the creation of the article. They link to a couple of lines of sources at the end of the article. We don't include these sourcelines and therefore the references are also useless in our extension.

## Ext-phonos
Ext-phonos are icons that, when clicked play a small clip of audio with the correct pronunciation of subject. Since clicking the icons wouldn't do anything in our extension we want to remove them altogether.

## Amboxes
Amboxes are information boxes that are placed atop an article by moderators to notify users for potential problems with an article, however, as we work with limited space to print out our results we dont want to include the amboxes.
